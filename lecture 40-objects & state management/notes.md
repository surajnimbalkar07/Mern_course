# Lecture 40 - JavaScript Encapsulation and DOM Handling

> Here we learned how to use **encapsulation** in JavaScript.
> We grouped related **data** (like `count` and `level`) and **functions** (like `updateLevel` and event handling) inside a single object.
> This way, everything related to the counter is organized in one place, making the code easier to manage and avoiding global variables.
> We also learned how to select DOM elements, handle events, and update the UI dynamically using this object.

A beginner-friendly guide on **encapsulation, DOM manipulation, and event handling** in JavaScript.

## **Encapsulation in JavaScript**

* **Encapsulation** means grouping related **data** and **functions** into a **single object**.
* Helps **organize code**, avoid global variables, and makes maintenance easier.

**Example Concepts Learned:**

* Data like `count` and `level` stored in the object.
* Functions like `updateLevel` or event handlers grouped inside the same object.
* Object handles both **logic** and **UI updates**, keeping everything in one place.

## **DOM Manipulation and Event Handling**

* Selecting elements from the DOM using `querySelector` or `getElementById`.
* Adding event listeners to handle **clicks or input changes**.
* Updating the UI dynamically by changing element properties like `textContent` or `value`.

**Benefits:**

* Keeps related functionality together.
* Reduces global variables.
* Makes code readable and maintainable.

**Takeaway:**
Encapsulation + DOM manipulation = **clean, organized, and dynamic interactive code**.
