        // Here we learned how to use encapsulation in JavaScript. 
        // We grouped related data (like count and level) and functions
        //  (like updateLevel and event handling) inside a single object. 
        // This way, everything related to the counter is organized in one place,
        //  making the code easier to manage and avoiding global variables. 
        // We also learned how to select DOM elements, handle events, and 
        // update the UI dynamically using this object.
