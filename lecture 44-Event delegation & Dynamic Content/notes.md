capturing phase:

going down i.e going down from root to target


Bubbling phase:
going up i.e from target to root

target:
element that has triggered event

why we have to use event delegation?:

problem occur when we have multiple child and have to apply
event listener, its unable to add it dynamically thats why 
we use event delegation


when we have multiple children it will take more memory,
changing is difficult and it error prone
